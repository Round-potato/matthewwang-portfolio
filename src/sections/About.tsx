            Hey, I&apos;m a first-year computer science student at the University of British Columbia.
            I love problem-solving, and especially the kind that forces me to learn new skills to truly
            understand how things work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of tech, I&apos;m drawn to the arts. I love photography, videography, and storytelling.
            They let me express how I see the world and the people around me.
          </p>

             Cooking is my love language and food is my place of comfort. Creating something from scratch
            feels a lot like coding because itâ€™s creative, iterative, and deeply rewarding.
          </p>

            A little bit of this, a little bit of that~~~
